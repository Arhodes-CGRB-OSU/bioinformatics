This repository contains a broad, but probably incomplete, collection of scripts I developed for my bioinformatics analyses.


Organization of files
---------------------
Thus far, *python* and *ruby* scripts are included in separate folders. I have further created subfolders for scripts that relate to specific programs/databases (e.g. Pfam, GeneOntology) or file formats (e.g. fasta, gff). The *base* folder includes sources that may be imported and therefore required by other scripts.


Documentation
-------------
Documentation is almost non-existant, and if present in scripts, it may be outdated. However, naming of the scripts themsolves as well as their subroutines should make it easy to reconstruct how/when/where each of the programs can be applied.
